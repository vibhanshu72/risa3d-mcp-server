# Changelog

All notable changes to the RISA-3D MCP Server are documented here.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06

### Added

**Tool 13 -- `batch_summarize_folder`**
Scans a folder for all `.r3d` files and returns a single CSV summary table with one row per model. Each row includes file name, model title, designer, node count, member count, section set count, load combination count, file size, and a quick QC status (flags unassigned sections and invalid node references). Optional `filterName` parameter to match only files whose name contains a specific string. Useful for project-wide QC and cross-model reporting across all stair or platform models in a project folder.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06

### Added

**Tool 9 -- `get_model_materials`**
Lists all HR and CF steel materials defined in the model. Returns Grade, E (ksi), Fy (ksi), and Fu (ksi) as CSV. Useful for QC and design narrative writing.

**Tool 10 -- `get_boundary_conditions`**
Lists all constrained nodes with their support conditions. Resolves node indices to node labels, translates RISA constraint codes (4=Fixed, 0=Free, 1=Spring, etc.) to human-readable text, and adds a plain-English description column (Fixed, Pinned, or the specific combination of constraints).

**Tool 11 -- `get_section_sets`**
Lists all named hot-rolled steel section sets and their assigned types and sizes as CSV. Directly useful for design review -- shows what sections are assigned to each named group (e.g. Stringers, Posts, Hangers).

**Tool 12 -- `summarize_model_for_report`**
Single-call model summary combining project info, nodes, members, section sets, materials, boundary conditions, load combinations, area loads, distributed loads, and point loads. Replaces 6+ separate tool calls. Output is structured for pasting directly into a calculation package or design narrative.

### Changed

**`list_members` -- token efficiency refactor**
Now returns a compact type breakdown by default (e.g. "168 members total: 62 Tube, 45 Wide Flange, 38 Channel, 23 Angle"). Use `mode="full"` for full CSV detail. Optional `filterType` parameter (e.g. `"Tube"`, `"Wide Flange"`) returns only matching members.

**`export_member_schedule` -- token efficiency refactor**
Now supports optional `filterType` to export only one member type. Added `maxRows` parameter (default 200) to prevent runaway token usage on large models. Shows a warning if the result is capped.

### Fixed

**Correct load section names documented**
RISA-3D stores point/nodal loads under `[NODE_LOADS]` (not `[JOINT_LOADS]`) and member distributed loads under `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]` (not `[MEMBER_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`). The summarize tool and technical notes now reflect the correct section names.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05

### Added

Initial release with 8 tools:

- `read_risa_model` -- project summary (title, node count, member count, file size)
- `list_members` -- all members with type, size, and resolved i/j node labels
- `list_nodes` -- all nodes with X, Y, Z coordinates
- `list_load_combinations` -- all load combination names
- `get_file_section` -- raw contents of any named file section
- `compare_risa_models` -- diff two `.r3d` files (nodes, members, section sets, load combos)
- `export_member_schedule` -- member schedule as CSV with calculated lengths
- `qc_check_risa_model` -- checks for duplicate nodes, duplicate members, missing sections, zero-length members, invalid node references

### Technical notes documented

- Fixed-width quoted fields require a quote-aware tokenizer
- Member i/j node references are 1-based positional indices into the `[NODES]` list, not label strings
