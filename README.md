# RISA-3D MCP Server

> Connect Claude AI to your RISA-3D structural models using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Built by a structural engineer, for structural engineers. This MCP server lets you talk to your `.r3d` files in plain English -- no coding required after setup.

---

## Demo

> *"Summarize this model for a report"*
> *"What steel grade is this model using?"*
> *"What are the boundary conditions at the column bases?"*
> *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*

Once connected, just point Claude at any `.r3d` file and start asking questions.

---

## What Is This?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect to external tools and files. This server acts as a bridge between Claude Desktop and your RISA-3D models. Claude reads your `.r3d` files directly and answers questions about them in plain English.

No RISA-3D API is required. This works by reading RISA-3D's plain-text `.r3d` file format directly.

---

## What You Can Do

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- *"Summarize this model for a report -- include members, nodes, loads, boundary conditions, and materials"*
- *"What steel grade and Fy value is assigned in this model?"*
- *"List all the boundary conditions -- which nodes are fixed vs. pinned?"*
- *"What section sizes are assigned to each section set?"*
- *"List all the members and their section sizes"*
- *"Run a QC check on this model"*
- *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*
- *"Export a member schedule for all HSS members"*

---

## Requirements

- Windows PC with RISA-3D installed
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (free)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version -- free)
- A Claude account (Pro plan recommended)

---

## Installation

### Step 1 -- Install Node.js

Download and install the **LTS version** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Click through all the defaults.

Verify it worked -- open Command Prompt and run:
```
node --version
npm --version
```
Both should return version numbers.

---

### Step 2 -- Set Up the MCP Server

Open Command Prompt and run these one at a time:

```bash
mkdir C:\risa-mcp
cd C:\risa-mcp
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod xlsx
```

---

### Step 3 -- Create the Server File

In Command Prompt, run:
```
notepad index.js
```

Click **Yes** when asked to create a new file. Paste in the contents of `index.js` from this repository, then save and close.

---

### Step 4 -- Update package.json

In Command Prompt, run:
```
notepad package.json
```

Add `"type": "module"` so it looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "risa-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.0.0",
    "zod": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

Save and close.

---

### Step 5 -- Test the Server

In Command Prompt, run:
```
cd C:\risa-mcp
node index.js
```

If you see a blinking cursor with no errors -- it is working. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop it.

---

### Step 6 -- Connect to Claude Desktop

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) if you haven't already
2. Press **Windows + R**, type `%APPDATA%\Claude` and press Enter
3. Open or create `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Paste in the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "risa3d": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\risa-mcp\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file
6. Fully quit Claude Desktop (right-click the system tray icon -> Quit)
7. Reopen Claude Desktop

---

### Step 7 -- Verify It's Running

In Claude Desktop:
1. Click the **+** button in the chat input box
2. Click **Connectors**
3. You should see **risa3d** listed as connected

Or go to **Settings -> Developer** and confirm risa3d shows as **running**.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `read_risa_model` | Reads a `.r3d` file and returns a project summary (title, node count, member count, plate count, file size) |
| `list_members` | Returns a type breakdown summary by default (token-efficient). Use `mode="full"` for full CSV detail. Optional `filterType` (e.g. `"Tube"`, `"Wide Flange"`) to narrow results. |
| `list_nodes` | Lists all nodes with their X, Y, Z coordinates |
| `list_load_combinations` | Lists all load combinations defined in the model |
| `get_file_section` | Returns the raw contents of any named section in the file (e.g. NODES, MEMBERS, BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS) |
| `compare_risa_models` | Compares two `.r3d` files and reports differences in nodes, member sizes/connectivity, section sets, and load combinations |
| `export_member_schedule` | Generates a member schedule as CSV (label, type, size, nodes, length). Optional `filterType` to export one section type. Optional `maxRows` cap (default 200). |
| `qc_check_risa_model` | Checks for duplicate nodes, duplicate member labels, missing section sizes, zero-length members, and invalid node references |
| `get_model_materials` | Lists all HR and CF steel materials defined in the model with Grade, E, Fy, and Fu values |
| `get_boundary_conditions` | Lists all support conditions with node labels, constraint codes (Fixed/Free/Pinned), and plain-English descriptions |
| `get_section_sets` | Lists all named section sets and their assigned types and sizes |
| `summarize_model_for_report` | Single-call summary combining project info, nodes, members, section sets, materials, boundary conditions, load combinations, area loads, distributed loads, and point loads -- ready to paste into a calculation package |
| `batch_summarize_folder` | Scans a folder for all `.r3d` files and returns a CSV summary table (file name, title, designer, node count, member count, section sets, load combos, file size, QC status). Optional `filterName` parameter to match specific file names. |
| `get_load_cases` | Lists all basic load cases defined in the model with their index, name, and load type (Gravity, Seismic, Wind, etc.) |
| `find_members_by_section` | Returns all members assigned a specific section size. Accepts partial, case-insensitive matches (e.g. `"hss8"` matches `"HSS8X8X10"`). If no match, it lists all sizes in the model. |
| `get_deflection_limits` | Returns the deflection limit ratios (L/240, L/360, etc.) defined in both the global deflection rules and member deflection rules. Shows "Not checked" for any category set to -1. |
| `modify_section_set` | Changes a section size and saves a NEW `.r3d` file (never overwrites the original). Can change the section set definition, specific member assignments, or both. Optional `setName` or `memberLabel` to narrow the change to a single set or member. |
| `clone_model_with_changes` | Saves a copy of the model with one or more changes applied: section sizes, boundary conditions, and member distributed load magnitudes. Always writes to a new file. Useful for parametric studies and what-if comparisons. |
| `get_material_takeoff` | Returns total weight by section size and a grand total, calculated from AISC shape designations (W/C shapes: number after the X is lb/ft) plus a lookup table for HSS and angle shapes. Sizes not in the table are flagged as unknown rather than guessed, and excluded from the total. |
| `find_unbraced_length_issues` | Flags members longer than a threshold (default 15 ft, adjustable) for manual review. This is a length screen only -- it does NOT calculate KL/r, apply K-factors, or account for intermediate brace points. Intended to surface candidates for engineering judgment, not to replace it. |
| `export_member_schedule_to_excel` | Writes the member schedule directly to a real `.xlsx` file at a path you specify, instead of returning CSV text to copy-paste. |
| `batch_summarize_folder_to_excel` | Writes the batch folder summary directly to a real `.xlsx` file. Same data as `batch_summarize_folder`, saved as an actual spreadsheet. |

## Technical Notes on the `.r3d` Format

Several non-obvious quirks in RISA's file format that this server handles, documented here for anyone extending it:

**1. Fixed-width quoted fields.** Labels, types, and section sizes are stored as quote-padded strings, e.g. `"M14                             "`. A naive whitespace split breaks these into multiple phantom tokens. This server uses a quote-aware tokenizer that treats anything inside `"..."` (including internal spaces) as a single field.

**2. Members reference nodes by position, not by label.** In `[.MEMBERS_MAIN_DATA]`, the i-node and j-node fields are 1-based indices into the order of the `[NODES]` list -- not the node label strings. For example, a member line containing `1 7` means the 1st node listed to the 7th node listed, which might resolve to `N5` and `N18`. This server resolves those indices against an ordered node array.

**3. Load section names.** Point/nodal loads are stored under `[NODE_LOADS]`, not `[JOINT_LOADS]`. Member distributed loads are stored under `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, not `[MEMBER_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`.

**4. Load case IDs in load sections.** The load case index stored in `[NODE_LOADS]`, `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, and `[AREA_LOADS]` entries is an internal RISA database ID, not the sequential 1-based index from `[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]`. When no name match is found, the tool labels the load case as `LC{n}`.

The member line format (after tokenizing) is:
```
Label, Type (e.g. "Wide Flange", "Tube", "Channel", "None"), Size (e.g. "W14X22", "HSS8X8X10"), iNodeIndex, jNodeIndex, ...
```
