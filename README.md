## Demo

> *"Summarize this model for a report"*
> *"What steel grade is this model using?"*
> *"What are the boundary conditions at the column bases?"*
> *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*

Once connected, just point Claude at any `.r3d` file and start asking questions.

---

## Why This Project Exists

RISA-3D has no public API.

This project bridges that gap by treating `.r3d` files as the interface, allowing AI assistants to inspect, compare, modify, and report on structural models without automating the RISA application itself.

The goal is to augment structural engineers—not replace engineering judgment.

---

## What Is This?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect to external tools and files. This server acts as a bridge between Claude Desktop and your RISA-3D models. Claude reads your `.r3d` files directly and answers questions about them in plain English.

No RISA-3D API is required. This works by reading RISA-3D's plain-text `.r3d` file format directly. Includes a modular regression test suite to ensure parser and write-tool reliability as the project evolves

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibhanshu-mishra/risa3d-mcp-server.git

cd risa3d-mcp-server

npm install

node risa-cli.js help
```

## What This Server Does

This MCP server reads and modifies `.r3d` RISA-3D model files.
It can:

- Read nodes, members, sections, supports, load cases, and load combinations
- Generate model summaries
- Generate load summaries grouped by RISA basic load case
- Export member schedules to Excel
- Clone a model with controlled changes
- Run QA/QC checks on RISA models
- Run CLI diagnostics without Claude/MCP

Currently includes 40+ MCP tools covering: 

- Model interrogation
- QA/QC
- Load Parsing & Validation
- Material Takeoffs
- SAF and Excel Exports
- Model Comparison
- Model Cloning and Editing
- CLI Debugging Toolkit
- Geometry Editing
- Batch Workflows
- Regression-tested Parsing Utilities

---

## Use Without Claude

The project includes a standalone command-line interface (`risa-cli.js`).

This allows engineers to test parsing logic and generate reports without installing Claude Desktop or using MCP.

Example:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\Models\TEST.r3d"
```

Useful for:

- Testing parser changes
- Verifying load extraction
- Debugging RISA files
- Running reports locally

---

## What You Can Do

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- *"Summarize this model for a report -- include members, nodes, loads, boundary conditions, and materials"*
- *"What steel grade and Fy value is assigned in this model?"*
- *"List all the boundary conditions, which nodes are fixed vs. pinned?"*
- *"What section sizes are assigned to each section set?"*
- *"List all the members and their section sizes"*
- *"Run a QC check on this model"*
- *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*
- *"Export a member schedule for all HSS members"*

---

## RISA-3D Load Parsing

RISA-3D `.r3d` files do not always store visible load case names directly inside load rows. For example, load rows may contain internal raw IDs like:

```text
88
89
90
```

These are internal RISA load identifiers and should not be assumed to match the visible Basic Load Case numbering shown in the RISA interface.

This project resolves loads using the confirmed RISA pattern:

```text
[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]
  -> distributed load count
  -> area load count
  -> node load count
  -> row order inside load tables
```

The shared helper `parseLoadsByBasicLoadCase(content)` groups loads by visible RISA Basic Load Case name, such as:

```text
DL
LL
WLx
WLz
BLC 1 Transient Area Loads
```

instead of exposing internal raw IDs.

---

## Current Load Editing Support

`clone_model_with_changes` currently supports:

- Section size changes
- Boundary condition changes
- Member distributed load magnitude changes
- Node load magnitude changes

It does **not** currently edit area loads.

Area loads are intentionally excluded because RISA may generate transient/memberized distributed loads from area loads. Editing the area loads without regenerating those derived loads could create an inconsistent model.

---

## CLI Usage

The CLI lives in `risa-cli.js`. Run commands from the project folder:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js help
```

### Generate Load Summary

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

Include generated transient load cases:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\path\to\model.r3d" --include-transient
```

### Debug Load Case Counts

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-case-counts "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

### Debug Raw Load Structure

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-structure "C:\path\to\model.r3d" 10
```

### Debug Member Load Rows

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-member-load-rows "C:\path\to\model.r3d" M41
```

### Debug Load Membership

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-membership "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

---

## MCP Usage

Start the MCP server with:

```cmd
node index.js
```

In your MCP client config, point to:

```cmd
node C:\path\to\risa3d-mcp-server\index.js
```

## Safety Notes

- The server never overwrites the original file when cloning.
- Use `clone_model_with_changes` with a different `outputPath`.
- Always open cloned `.r3d` files in RISA-3D and verify the model before using them for design.
- Write/edit tools should be treated as engineering-assist tools, not final design authority.

---

## Development Workflow

Typical workflow used during development:

1. Add or modify a parser in `risa-core.js`
2. Test locally using `risa-cli.js`
3. Validate against a real `.r3d` file
4. Move the logic into the MCP tools in `index.js`
5. Test again through Claude Desktop

The CLI exists specifically so parser development does not require Claude or MCP during iteration.

---

## Developer Checks

Before committing changes, run:

```cmd
node --check index.js
node --check risa-core.js
node --check risa-cli.js
```

---

## Regression Tests

This project includes a modular regression test suite to protect the parser and write helpers from breaking during future development.

Run the full suite:

```cmd
node tests\run-all.js
```

Current coverage:

- Parser
- Load ownership
- Geometry helpers
- QC engine
- Write helpers

---

## Technical Notes on the `.r3d` Format

Several non-obvious quirks in RISA's file format that this server handles, documented here for anyone extending it:

**1. Fixed-width quoted fields.** Labels, types, and section sizes are stored as quote-padded strings, e.g. `"M14                             "`. A naive whitespace split breaks these into multiple phantom tokens. This server uses a quote-aware tokenizer that treats anything inside `"..."` (including internal spaces) as a single field.

**2. Members reference nodes by position, not by label.** In `[.MEMBERS_MAIN_DATA]`, the i-node and j-node fields are 1-based indices into the order of the `[NODES]` list -- not the node label strings. For example, a member line containing `1 7` means the 1st node listed to the 7th node listed, which might resolve to `N5` and `N18`. This server resolves those indices against an ordered node array.

**3. Load section names.** Point/nodal loads are stored under `[NODE_LOADS]`, not `[JOINT_LOADS]`. Member distributed loads are stored under `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, not `[MEMBER_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`.

**4. Load case IDs in load sections.** The load case index stored in `[NODE_LOADS]`, `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, and `[AREA_LOADS]` entries is an internal RISA database ID, not the sequential 1-based index from `[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]`. When no name match is found, the tool labels the load case as `LC{n}`.

The member line format (after tokenizing) is:
```
Label, Type (e.g. "Wide Flange", "Tube", "Channel", "None"), Size (e.g. "W14X22", "HSS8X8X10"), iNodeIndex, jNodeIndex, ...
```
