# RISA-3D MCP Server + CLI Toolkit

> Connect Claude AI to your RISA-3D structural models using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Built by a structural engineer, for structural engineers. This MCP server lets you talk to your `.r3d` files in plain English -- no coding required after setup.

---

## Demo

> *"Summarize this model for a report"*
> *"What steel grade is this model using?"*
> *"What are the boundary conditions at the column bases?"*
> *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*

Once connected, just point Claude at any `.r3d` file and start asking questions.

---

## What Is This?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect to external tools and files. This server acts as a bridge between Claude Desktop and your RISA-3D models. Claude reads your `.r3d` files directly and answers questions about them in plain English.

No RISA-3D API is required. This works by reading RISA-3D's plain-text `.r3d` file format directly.

## What This Server Does

This MCP server reads and modifies `.r3d` RISA-3D model files.
It can:

- Read nodes, members, sections, supports, load cases, and load combinations
- Generate model summaries
- Generate load summaries grouped by RISA basic load case
- Export member schedules to Excel
- Clone a model with controlled changes
- Run QA/QC checks on RISA models
- Run CLI diagnostics without Claude/MCP

---

## Use Without Claude

The project includes a standalone command-line interface (`risa-cli.js`).

This allows engineers to test parsing logic and generate reports without installing Claude Desktop or using MCP.

Example:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\Models\TEST.r3d"
```

Useful for:

- Testing parser changes
- Verifying load extraction
- Debugging RISA files
- Running reports locally

---

## What You Can Do

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- *"Summarize this model for a report -- include members, nodes, loads, boundary conditions, and materials"*
- *"What steel grade and Fy value is assigned in this model?"*
- *"List all the boundary conditions -- which nodes are fixed vs. pinned?"*
- *"What section sizes are assigned to each section set?"*
- *"List all the members and their section sizes"*
- *"Run a QC check on this model"*
- *"Compare these two models and tell me what changed"*
- *"Export a member schedule for all HSS members"*

---

## Requirements

- Windows PC with RISA-3D installed
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (free)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version -- free)
- A Claude account (Pro plan recommended)

---

## Installation

### Step 1 -- Install Node.js

Download and install the **LTS version** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Click through all the defaults.

Verify it worked -- open Command Prompt and run:
```
node --version
npm --version
```
Both should return version numbers.

---

### Step 2 -- Set Up the MCP Server

Open Command Prompt and run these one at a time:

```bash
mkdir C:\risa-mcp
cd C:\risa-mcp
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod xlsx
```

---

### Step 3 -- Create the Server File

In Command Prompt, run:
```
notepad index.js
```

Click **Yes** when asked to create a new file. Paste in the contents of `index.js` from this repository, then save and close.

---

### Step 4 -- Update package.json

In Command Prompt, run:
```
notepad package.json
```

Add `"type": "module"` so it looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "risa-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.0.0",
    "zod": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

Save and close.

---

### Step 5 -- Test the Server

In Command Prompt, run:
```
cd C:\risa-mcp
node index.js
```

If you see a blinking cursor with no errors -- it is working. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop it.

---

### Step 6 -- Connect to Claude Desktop

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) if you haven't already
2. Press **Windows + R**, type `%APPDATA%\Claude` and press Enter
3. Open or create `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Paste in the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "risa3d": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\risa-mcp\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file
6. Fully quit Claude Desktop (right-click the system tray icon -> Quit)
7. Reopen Claude Desktop

---

### Step 7 -- Verify It's Running

In Claude Desktop:
1. Click the **+** button in the chat input box
2. Click **Connectors**
3. You should see **risa3d** listed as connected

Or go to **Settings -> Developer** and confirm risa3d shows as **running**.

| `list_nodes` | Lists all nodes with their X, Y, Z coordinates |
| `list_load_combinations` | Lists all load combinations defined in the model |
| `get_file_section` | Returns the raw contents of any named section in the file (e.g. NODES, MEMBERS, BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS) |
| `compare_risa_models` | Compares two `.r3d` files and reports differences in nodes, member sizes/connectivity, section sets, and load combinations |
| `export_member_schedule` | Generates a member schedule as CSV (label, type, size, nodes, length). Optional `filterType` to export one section type. Optional `maxRows` cap (default 200). |
| `qc_check_risa_model` | Checks for duplicate nodes, duplicate member labels, missing section sizes, zero-length members, and invalid node references |
| `get_model_materials` | Lists all HR and CF steel materials defined in the model with Grade, E, Fy, and Fu values |

| `get_section_sets` | Lists all named section sets and their assigned types and sizes |
| `summarize_model_for_report` | Single-call summary combining project info, nodes, members, section sets, materials, boundary conditions, load combinations, area loads, distributed loads, and point loads -- ready to paste into a calculation package |
| `batch_summarize_folder` | Scans a folder for all `.r3d` files and returns a CSV summary table (file name, title, designer, node count, member count, section sets, load combos, file size, QC status). Optional `filterName` parameter to match specific file names. |
| `get_load_cases` | Lists all basic load cases defined in the model with their index, name, and load type (Gravity, Seismic, Wind, etc.) |
| `find_members_by_section` | Returns all members assigned a specific section size. Accepts partial, case-insensitive matches (e.g. `"hss8"` matches `"HSS8X8X10"`). If no match, lists all sizes in the model. |
| `get_deflection_limits` | Returns the deflection limit ratios (L/240, L/360, etc.) defined in both the global deflection rules and member deflection rules. Shows "Not checked" for any category set to -1. |
| `modify_section_set` | Changes a section size and saves a NEW `.r3d` file (never overwrites the original). Can change the section set definition, specific member assignments, or both. Optional `setName` or `memberLabel` to narrow the change to a single set or member. |
| `clone_model_with_changes` | Saves a copy of the model with one or more changes applied: section sizes, boundary conditions, member distributed load magnitudes and node load magnitudes. Always writes to a new file. Useful for parametric studies and what-if comparisons. |
| `get_material_takeoff` | Returns total weight by section size and a grand total, calculated from AISC shape designations (W/C shapes: number after the X is lb/ft) plus a lookup table for HSS and angle shapes. Sizes not in the table are flagged as unknown rather than guessed, and excluded from the total. |
| `find_unbraced_length_issues` | Flags members longer than a threshold (default 15 ft, adjustable) for manual review. This is a length screen only -- it does NOT calculate KL/r, apply K-factors, or account for intermediate brace points. Intended to surface candidates for engineering judgment, not to replace it. |
| `export_member_schedule_to_excel` | Writes the member schedule directly to a real `.xlsx` file at a path you specify, instead of returning CSV text to copy-paste. |
| `batch_summarize_folder_to_excel` | Writes the batch folder summary directly to a real `.xlsx` file. Same data as `batch_summarize_folder`, saved as an actual spreadsheet. |
| `add_member` | Adds a new member to the model and saves a NEW `.r3d` file. Connects to two existing nodes (by label) or creates new nodes at given coordinates, always appended to the end of the model so no existing member's node references shift. Clones the field structure from an existing member of the same type to avoid guessing internal RISA codes. Requires at least one existing member of the target type already in the model. |
| `export_to_saf` | Exports a RISA-3D model to SAF format (`.xlsx`), the open exchange standard used by SCIA Engineer, SOFiSTiK, AxisVM, and other structural analysis software. Produces five sheets: StructuralMaterial, StructuralCrossSection, StructuralPointConnection, StructuralCurveMember, StructuralPointSupport, plus a NOTES sheet documenting two key limitations: (1) coordinates are converted from feet to meters, and (2) RISA's Y-vertical axis is NOT swapped to Z-vertical -- the receiving engineer must handle axis orientation. Loads are not included in this export. |
| `find_duplicate_nodes` | Scans all nodes for pairs with nearly identical coordinates (default tolerance 0.001 ft, ~0.3mm). Duplicate nodes cause members to appear connected when they aren't, or produce zero-length members that silently corrupt analysis results. Flags pairs by label with exact distance and coordinates. |
| `replace_section_size_in_folder` | Replaces a section size string across every `.r3d` file in a folder, saving each as a new file with a configurable suffix (never overwrites originals). Useful for applying a spec change across an entire project folder at once. Reports how many replacements were made per file, and skips files with no matches. |
| `compare_risa_models` | Diffs two `.r3d` files and reports exactly what changed: nodes added, removed, or moved; members added, removed, or changed (size, type, or connectivity); section sets added, removed, or resized; and load combination count changes. Useful for tracking design iterations and documenting changes between submittals. |

## Important RISA-3D Load Parsing Note

RISA-3D `.r3d` files do not always store visible load case names directly inside load rows. For example, load rows may contain internal raw IDs like:

```text
88
89
90
```

These are not necessarily the visible Basic Load Case numbers shown in RISA.

This project resolves loads using the confirmed RISA pattern:

```text
[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]
  -> distributed load count
  -> area load count
  -> node load count
  -> row order inside load tables
```

The shared helper `parseLoadsByBasicLoadCase(content)` groups loads by visible RISA Basic Load Case name, such as:

```text
DL
LL
WLx
WLz
BLC 1 Transient Area Loads
```

instead of exposing internal raw IDs.

---

## Current Load Editing Support

`clone_model_with_changes` currently supports:

- Section size changes
- Boundary condition changes
- Member distributed load magnitude changes
- Node load magnitude changes

It does **not** currently edit area loads.

Area loads are intentionally excluded because RISA may generate transient/memberized distributed loads from area loads. Editing area loads without regenerating those derived loads could create an inconsistent model.

---

## CLI Usage

The CLI lives in `risa-cli.js`. Run commands from the project folder:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js help
```

### Generate Load Summary

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

Include generated transient load cases:

```cmd
node risa-cli.js generate-load-summary "C:\path\to\model.r3d" --include-transient
```

### Debug Load Case Counts

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-case-counts "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

### Debug Raw Load Structure

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-structure "C:\path\to\model.r3d" 10
```

### Debug Member Load Rows

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-member-load-rows "C:\path\to\model.r3d" M41
```

### Debug Load Membership

```cmd
node risa-cli.js debug-load-membership "C:\path\to\model.r3d"
```

---

## MCP Usage

Start the MCP server with:

```cmd
node index.js
```

In your MCP client config, point to:

```cmd
node C:\path\to\risa3d-mcp-server\index.js
```

## Load Parsing Discovery

During development, it was discovered that RISA-3D does not store the visible Basic Load Case number directly inside load rows.

For example:

```text
88
89
90
```

appear inside:

- NODE_LOADS
- DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS
- AREA_LOADS

These values are internal RISA identifiers and should not be interpreted as the visible load case number shown in the RISA interface.

Load ownership is determined using the counts stored in:

```text
[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]
```

Specifically:

- Distributed Load Count
- Area Load Count
- Node Load Count

The parser walks the load tables sequentially and assigns rows back to the correct Basic Load Case using those counts.

This behavior was validated against actual production RISA-3D models.

---

## Safety Notes

- The server never overwrites the original file when cloning.
- Use `clone_model_with_changes` with a different `outputPath`.
- Always open cloned `.r3d` files in RISA-3D and verify the model before using them for design.
- Write/edit tools should be treated as engineering-assist tools, not final design authority.

---

## Development Workflow

Typical workflow used during development:

1. Add or modify a parser in `risa-core.js`
2. Test locally using `risa-cli.js`
3. Validate against a real `.r3d` file
4. Move the logic into MCP tools in `index.js`
5. Test again through Claude Desktop

The CLI exists specifically so parser development does not require Claude or MCP during iteration.

## Technical Notes on the `.r3d` Format

Several non-obvious quirks in RISA's file format that this server handles, documented here for anyone extending it:

**1. Fixed-width quoted fields.** Labels, types, and section sizes are stored as quote-padded strings, e.g. `"M14                             "`. A naive whitespace split breaks these into multiple phantom tokens. This server uses a quote-aware tokenizer that treats anything inside `"..."` (including internal spaces) as a single field.

**2. Members reference nodes by position, not by label.** In `[.MEMBERS_MAIN_DATA]`, the i-node and j-node fields are 1-based indices into the order of the `[NODES]` list -- not the node label strings. For example, a member line containing `1 7` means the 1st node listed to the 7th node listed, which might resolve to `N5` and `N18`. This server resolves those indices against an ordered node array.

**3. Load section names.** Point/nodal loads are stored under `[NODE_LOADS]`, not `[JOINT_LOADS]`. Member distributed loads are stored under `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, not `[MEMBER_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`.

**4. Load case IDs in load sections.** The load case index stored in `[NODE_LOADS]`, `[DIRECT_DISTRIBUTED_LOADS]`, and `[AREA_LOADS]` entries is an internal RISA database ID, not the sequential 1-based index from `[BASIC_LOAD_CASES]`. When no name match is found, the tool labels the load case as `LC{n}`.

The member line format (after tokenizing) is:
```
Label, Type (e.g. "Wide Flange", "Tube", "Channel", "None"), Size (e.g. "W14X22", "HSS8X8X10"), iNodeIndex, jNodeIndex, ...
```

Current limitations:

- Area load editing is not supported.
- Generated transient/memberized loads are read but not regenerated.
- The server does not run RISA analysis.
- The server does not run RISA design checks.
- The server reads and modifies `.r3d` files only.
- Write operations should always be verified inside RISA-3D before engineering use.
